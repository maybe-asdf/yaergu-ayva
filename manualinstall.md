# Manual Installation Guide
Make sure you have git installed
cd into your home directory
```git clone https://github.com/maybe-asdf/yaergu-ayva/```
You should now have a folder named yaergu-ayva in your home folder.
Move the file 'ayva.desktop' to /home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/applications/
of course replacing YOURUSERNAME with your actual username
Run this command while in the yaergu-ayva folder :
```sudo mv ayva /usr/bin/```
Rename that folder to '.ayva' without the quotations
Tada!! It should work without any problems now.
